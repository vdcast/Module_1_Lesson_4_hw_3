# Module_1_Lesson_4_hw_3
**Lesson's topic:**

Classes, objects, constructors.

**Technical task:**

1. Make a Car class.
2. It should have 3 fields: model(String), fuel consumption - number of liters of gasoline per 1 km, amount of gasoline in the tank.
3. There must be a “start” method (startEngine). Do not let the car drive with the engine off :)
4. Make a method for filling gasoline into the car.
5. Make the driving method 1 km. In it, describe the following logic: If there is enough gasoline, then drive and write to the log that you have traveled 1 km. If there is not enough gasoline, then write to the log that the gasoline is over.
6. In MainActivity make a cycle for driving. "Drive" until the end of gasoline.
7. In the cycle, think over refueling in order to drive at least 1200 km.

1. Drive until the end of gasoline.
